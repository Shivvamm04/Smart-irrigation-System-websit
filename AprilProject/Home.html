        <h2>SIS --:</h2>
        <p>The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT based device which is capable of automating the irrigation process by analyzing the moisture of soil and the climate condition (like raining).Also the data of sensors will be displayed in graphical form on BOLT cloud page. Technology has advanced to the point where there’s no need to manage irrigation manually. Smart irrigation controllers use external information like weather data and/or soil moisture to determine frequency and length of watering cycles. Controllers receive frequent updates on weather or soil moisture and adjust watering schedules, accordingly. This means less manual intervention for rainy days which translates into better, more efficient water management.</p>

    <div class="l-info2">
        <p>One of the greatest advantages of a smart irrigation system is its ability to save water. Generally speaking, traditional watering methods can waste as much as 50% of the water used due to inefficiencies in irrigation, evaporation and overwatering.</p>
